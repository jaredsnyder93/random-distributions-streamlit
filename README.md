# Random Distributions – Streamlit Demo

This repository contains a simple Streamlit application demonstrating the
Central Limit Theorem.

The app shows how the distribution of sample means converges to a normal
distribution as sample size increases, even when the underlying data come
from non-normal distributions such as the exponential distribution.
